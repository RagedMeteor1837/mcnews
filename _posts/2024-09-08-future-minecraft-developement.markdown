title: The future of Minecraft’s development
---

This year marks Minecraft's fifteenth birthday—a milestone that celebrates 15 years of mining, crafting, surviving, and evolving together. Since its humble beginnings as Cave Game in 2009, Minecraft has grown with each free update, from jungle biomes in 2012 to trial chambers in 2024. This journey has been possible thanks to you, our cherished community, who have shaped the game every step of the way.<br>

As we look to our sixteenth birthday and beyond, we’re excited to share our plans for Minecraft’s future: delivering new features more regularly, revamping Minecraft Live, and continuing to improve your experience.<br>

**MORE REGULAR GAME UPDATES:**<br>
We’re changing how we release new content. Instead of a single summer update each year, we’ll now roll out multiple free game drops throughout the year, varying in size and frequency. This approach started with the [December 2023](https://www.minecraft.net/article/bats-pots-and-competitions) update, introducing visual changes to bats and functional storage for decorated pots. In April 2024, the [Armored Paws](https://www.minecraft.net/article/armored-paws) drop brought armadillos, wolf variations, and wolf armor.<br>
Beyond these updates, our developers remain committed to long-term initiatives, ensuring Minecraft evolves for years to come. Exciting projects include a native PlayStation®5 version of the game and improvements to Minecraft’s multiplayer experience, making it easier than ever to connect with friends.<br>

**A NEW MINECRAFT LIVE:**<br>
Minecraft Live is evolving! Instead of one annual show in October, there will now be two focused broadcasts each year. These events will provide regular updates on new features, testing developments, and news from across the Minecraft franchise. While we’re retiring the mob vote, this new format ensures more frequent engagement with the latest game developments.<br>

**A FUTURE SHAPED TOGETHER:**<br>
Your feedback has been, and will continue to be, a cornerstone of Minecraft’s development. Community suggestions have led to additions like cherry groves in the Trails & Tales Update and biome-based wolf variations. Feedback during development also refines features, such as improving the armadillo’s design based on community input.<br>
Together, we’ve crafted a game that stands the test of time, and we’re excited to shape Minecraft’s future alongside you. Thank you for being part of this incredible journey!<br>
