title: The future of Minecraft’s development
---

This year marks Minecraft's fifteenth birthday—a milestone that celebrates 15 years of mining, crafting, surviving, and evolving together. Since its humble beginnings as Cave Game in 2009, Minecraft has grown with each free update, from jungle biomes in 2012 to trial chambers in 2024. This journey has been possible thanks to you, our cherished community, who have shaped the game every step of the way.<br>

As we look to our sixteenth birthday and beyond, we’re excited to share our plans for Minecraft’s future: delivering new features more regularly, revamping Minecraft Live, and continuing to improve your experience.<br><br>

**MORE REGULAR GAME UPDATES:**<br>
We’re shifting from one free summer update to multiple free game drops throughout the year, starting with changes like functional decorated pots in December 2023 and the Armored Paws update in April 2024. These game drops will vary in size and will bring you features to explore more frequently.<br>
Alongside these updates, we’re working on a native PlayStation®5 version and improvements to multiplayer, making it easier to connect with friends.<br><br>

**A NEW MINECRAFT LIVE:**<br>
Minecraft Live is evolving! Instead of one annual show in October, there will now be two focused broadcasts each year. These events will provide regular updates on new features, testing developments, and news from across the Minecraft franchise. While we’re retiring the mob vote, this new format ensures more frequent engagement with the latest game developments.<br><br>

**A FUTURE SHAPED TOGETHER:**<br>
Your feedback drives Minecraft’s evolution, from suggesting cherry groves to refining features like the armadillo’s design. Together, we’ve built a game that stands the test of time, and we’re excited to continue shaping its future with you. Thank you for being part of this incredible journey!<br>
